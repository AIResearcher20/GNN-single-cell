📌 📌 Overview

GNN-single-cell is a research framework for learning biologically meaningful cellular representations from single-cell transcriptomic data using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Unlike traditional machine learning approaches that treat cells as independent samples, GNN-single-cell explicitly models cell–cell relationships through a graph-based representation, enabling:

- Accurate cellular cluster prediction (91.11% accuracy on PBMC 3k Leiden-derived clusters)
- Biologically interpretable embeddings (Silhouette Score: 0.3156)
- Robust performance across noise levels (95.93% at 20% noise)
- Attention-based interpretability via GAT
- Cross-dataset generalization analysis (PBMC 3k → PBMC 68k)
- Multi-Omics-ready architecture (validated with an RNA + simulated ATAC proof-of-concept)

🔬 Biological Interpretation: The predicted clusters were biologically validated using canonical marker genes (LYZ, S100A8, NKG7, HLA-DRA), confirming that the learned representations capture known immune cell states.

Graph Construction

· Nodes: Individual cells
· Edges: k-Nearest Neighbors (k=20) in PCA space
· Graph Type: Undirected, symmetric kNN graph
· Construction: Built only from training data to prevent data leakage

Multi-Omics Extension (Proof of Concept)

The architecture is designed for seamless extension to multi-modal data:

scRNA-seq ────┐  
              ├──▶ Multi-Omics GNN ──▶ Integrated Embedding  
ATAC-seq ─────┤  
              │  
Spatial ──────┘

Note: This section is a proof of concept using simulated ATAC-like data. The architecture is compatible with real paired RNA+ATAC datasets (e.g., 10x Multiome).

📊 Results

1. Model Comparison (PBMC 3k)



Model Accuracy Macro F1 Parameters Training Time
GCN 81.67% 76.32% 3,744 0.33s
GAT (Ours) 91.11% 86.62% 12,096 0.61s
GraphSAGE 72.96% 66.82% 7,392 0.29s

Interpretation: GAT outperforms GCN and GraphSAGE, suggesting that attention mechanisms can better capture heterogeneous cellular neighborhoods.


---

2. Cross-Dataset Generalization (PBMC 3k → PBMC 68k)



Method Accuracy Macro F1
PCA + Logistic Regression 76.43% 61.08%
PCA + Random Forest 82.86% 65.32%
PCA + KNN 77.14% 61.94%
| GAT without feature alignment | 0.71% | 0.87% |
Key Insight: This result demonstrates that graph representations learned from one scRNA-seq dataset cannot be directly transferred across datasets with different feature spaces without alignment strategies.

Important Note: The feature spaces of PBMC 3k (32,738 genes) and PBMC 68k (765 genes) are incompatible. This cross-dataset evaluation was performed using the classifier trained on PBMC 3k embeddings, not the full model with PCA alignment. Future work will explore feature alignment strategies.

3. Robustness to Noise



Noise Level Accuracy Macro F1
5% 95.37% 95.56%
10% 93.89% 90.01%
20% 95.93% 93.15%

Interpretation: The model maintains high performance even with 20% noise, demonstrating strong robustness and suitability for real-world noisy biological data.


---

4. Embedding Quality Metrics



Metric Value Interpretation
Silhouette Score 0.3156 Moderate separation between clusters
Davies-Bouldin Index 1.0276 Low similarity between clusters
Calinski-Harabasz Index 189.66 Good cluster separation
ECE (Calibration) 0.1048 Well-calibrated model
Brier Score 0.0571 Good probabilistic predictions


---

5. Ablation Study: Effect of k in kNN Graph



k Accuracy Macro F1
10 92.04% 93.25%
20 95.19% 95.17%
30 95.74% 90.61%

Interpretation: k=20 provides the best balance between graph connectivity and biological signal capture. k=10 results in under-connected graphs, while k=30 introduces noise.

Note1:Ablation experiments were conducted to analyze graph construction sensitivity rather than directly compare absolute model performance. The results inform architectural choices (k=20 selected for main experiments) and highlight the importance of graph connectivity in GNN performance.

Note2: The ablation study was performed using a different model configuration (GCN) and seed (42). The GAT results (91.11%) and ablation results (95.19%) are from separate experiments with different splits/seeds and should be interpreted as independent findings.

6. Multi-Modal Graph Learning Proof of Concept



Model Accuracy Macro F1
Single-Omics (RNA only) 91.11% 86.62%
Multi-Omics (RNA + ATAC-like) 85.74% 71.89%

Interpretation: The architecture successfully processes multi-modal inputs. The performance drop is expected due to simulated ATAC noise. With real paired RNA+ATAC data, performance can improve.

Attention Insights

High attention concentration was observed for isolated or rare cells, indicating adaptive weighting of local neighborhoods. The model learns to adjust attention based on cellular context, focusing on transcriptionally similar neighbors while down-weighting irrelevant connections.
